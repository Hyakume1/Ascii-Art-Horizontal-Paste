# Ascii-Art-Horizontal-Paste
Easy way to simply grab 2 ASCII art pieces and put them next to each other. User is able to add space or shorten it. Pretty useful for people wanting to combine 2 ASCII arts and use the output for things like terminal ricing.

Use:
-just copy paste the Ascii art in the terminal (at this point you can further add to the art, if you so please).
-once a line is blank and enter was pressed, it will prompt you for the second one
-you can input integers to increase of decrease the padding. default: 5
